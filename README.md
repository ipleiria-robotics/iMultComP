PRU-ICSS was designed with real-time industrial communications in mind. Ethernet, Fieldbus,interface, and redundancy protocols are available for the PRU-ICSS, including certified solutions for EtherCAT, PROFIBUS, PROFINET. 

 In the context of the SoC, there are three environments in which the PRU-ICSS is used: (CCStudio), TI RTOS running on the Arm core, and Linux running on the Arm core.

## PRU C Compiler 

TI provides de PRU C compiler in the PRU Code Generation Tools package, available in the `linuxdevkit/sysroots/x86_64_arago-linux/usr/share/ti/cgt-pru/`, if the operation system is ubuntu, this package is located in the installation folder of the Linux sdk, example: `~/ti-processor-sdk-linux-am335x-evm-xx.xx.xx.xx/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/share/ti/cgt-pru`. This C compiler is available as an add-on package for CCSudio or it can be transferred to the beaglebone, if you have the `Debian` version, and compile on the beaglebone itself.
