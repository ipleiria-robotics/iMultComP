# iMultComP

## Get started 

- This section provides the source code for each protocol. I will demonstrate how to upload the respective protocol to the AM3359 board through CCStudio. It is necessary to have Code composer studio installed as well as SDK_TI_RTOS_AM335x. Install the CCStudio SDK in `c:\` on windows or in the `/home/user_name/ti` folder on Linux.
- Note: The tutorial is based on the Linux operating system. At the end of the section I will demonstrate the necessary step to compile the project on the Windows operating system.
